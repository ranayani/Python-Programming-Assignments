    "### List down benefits of OOP?\n",
    "1. Simplicity: software objects model real world objects, so the complexity is reduced and the program structure is very clear.\n",
    "2. Modularity: each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other parts of the system.\n",
    "3. Modifiability: it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external world has to a class is through the use of methods.\n",
    "4. Extensibility: adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few new objects and modifying some existing ones.\n",
    "5. Maintainability: objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier.\n",
    "6. Re-usability: objects can be reused in different programs."
